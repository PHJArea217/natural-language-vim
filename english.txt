This is a test of the so-called "English" syntax
highlighting feature. I have an idea myself and
it could also be good for everyone. It isn't the
best idea, but it could be useful for people whose
first language isn't English. Notice how some of the
words that are common words in English are highlighted
and the less-common words aren't. That's really
cool! I've actually written a lot of programs in my
miniutils repository.
